### Design Ideas:

* datafields clustered thematically 
    * dropdown
    * one per page
    
* datafields as a list, scrollable
    * difficult if there are many fields
    * user can decide how many fields are shown
    
 * generic component to show data for the review tab
 
 * further information: 
    * pop-up with short description
    * new tap with detailed information
    * email address of admin to contact
    * datatype: integer, text
    
* language: multi-language support?

* class for JSON-Object that returns the object as a Proxy for the Backend
* we should count the interactionsteps with the app dependent on the number of input fields and minimize that number for convenience reasons
